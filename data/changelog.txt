	NIfTI_Data contains the .nii and .json files generated from /scratch/scw1648/full_dataset DICOMs by the get_nifti.sh script.

13.04.22 - CN
	FileIndicators.csv is a table with binary indicators (1/0) for the presence/absence of a scan from each subject's NIfTI data. (NOTE this is not the same as for DICOMs in full_dataset because not all DICOMs were converted to NIfTIs).

27.04.22 - CN
	Renamed anat files from *T1.nii & *T1.json to *T1w.nii & *T1w.json. This is the expected form in the mica-pipe processing pipeline (and may be the more correct form to conform with BIDS).

06.05.22 - CN
	Submitted micapipe_struct_sub.sh jobs to populate mica_processed with structural derivatives from NIfTI_Data. Applied all processing modules from mica-pipe. Check mica_struct_build_site for job logs.

11.05.22 - CN
	Copied unwarped rest and movie scans from proj_ht to proj_cn/Connectom_derivatives/NIfTI_Data (using ht_cn_copy.sh script). Files saved as sub-<ID>_<rest/movie>_unwarped.nii.

11.05.22 - CN
	Copy above highlighted discrepency: invalid permissions on sub-1153 rest DICOM prevented conversion to NIfTI. Corrected and ran individual dcm2niix as required to introduce these files. Also added unwarped file which was previously missing.

17.05.22 - CN
	All structural preprocessing runs completed.

24.05.22 - CN
	Functional processing jobs for all subjects submitted.

31.05.22 - CN
	All subjects' functional jobs (inc. re-runs) completed.
	NOTE: Failure in sub-1153 rest. Remains unexplained.

29.07.22 - CN
	Average FC calculated using calc_mean_surfs and saved under mica_processed/micapipe/mean_surfs

11.10.22 - CN
	Rsfmri functional gradients calculated across a range of method in the conte69-32k atlas, glasser-360 parcellation.

02.11.22 - CN
	Cleaned FC and timeseries data generated for the fsaverage5 atlas.
	Gradients calculated for a range of methods with this atlas in the glasser-360 parcellation.
